# Predicting Diagnosis

This project aims to find the best-performing models to predict diagnosis (Alzheimer's Disease/ Mild Cognitive Impairment/ Control) and age based on MRI features of brain regions. 

Investigative script uses data to find the best-performing models and combined pipeline that should be used on hidden test set.
Final pipeline code is the clean code that trains the data on the trainval data and attempts to predict on the test MRI features to find the accuracy

Further information about the background, aims and results can be found in the powerpoint presentation.
