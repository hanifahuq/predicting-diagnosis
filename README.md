# Predicting Diagnosis and Age

This project aims to find the best-performing models to predict diagnosis (Alzheimer's Disease/ Mild Cognitive Impairment/ Control) and age based on MRI features of brain regions. 

Investigative script uses trainval data to find the best-performing models and combined pipeline that should be used on hidden test set.
Final pipeline code is the clean code with the final pipeline that is trained on the trainval data and attempts to predict on the test MRI features data to find the accuracy to produce predictions.

Note: The 'test' and 'predictions' data is randomised data to ensure that my final pipeline runs on the same formatted data. The real test set and predictions were withheld, which is why I used the 'trainval' data for all investigations, including testing.

Further information about the background, aims and results can be found in the powerpoint presentation.
